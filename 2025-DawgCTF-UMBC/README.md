### Personal Reflection

Dawg CTF was an incredibly rewarding experience where our team placed in the top tier of competitors. This event was a personal highlight for me, as it was where my **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** skills truly shined. I took the lead on the OSINT category for my team and secured the majority of our points in that domain, while also contributing to Forensics, Reverse Engineering, and Misc challenges.

### Highlight Moment: The African Road Challenge

The most memorable and satisfying moment of the competition came from an OSINT challenge. We were presented with nothing more than a picture of an empty stretch of road somewhere in Africa and tasked with finding its exact geo-coordinates.

Through a meticulous process of analyzing soil color, sparse vegetation, the type of asphalt, and faint background details, I was able to narrow down the region and eventually pinpoint the precise location. This challenge was a testament to patience, analytical thinking, and the power of creative, open-source investigation. It was a fantastic feeling to crack it.

### What I Learned & Key Takeaways

-   **OSINT Mastery:** This CTF solidified my OSINT methodology, from image analysis and geo-location techniques to scouring social media and public records. It reinforced that even the smallest details can be the key to a solution.
-   **Cross-Category Contribution:** While OSINT was my focus, I was glad to be able to apply my skills to other categories, demonstrating versatility.
-   **Teamwork and Communication:** Our excellent team rank was a direct result of effective communication and playing to each other's strengths.

This was the road I had to geolocate!
