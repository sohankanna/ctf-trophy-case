### Personal Reflection

This was a high-caliber international competition, and I am extremely proud of my team for securing a top 7.5% finish among a thousand teams. The challenges were exceptionally well-designed, especially in Crypto and the technical categories I focused on. We successfully cleared two-thirds of the entire board, which reflects our team's breadth of skill and strong communication.

### Highlight: The American Sign Language (ASL) Challenge

The most unforgettable challenge was in the Misc category. Instead of code or ciphers, the flag was encoded using American Sign Language. This was a brilliant test of creative problem-solving and resourcefulness. It required us to step outside the typical cybersecurity toolkit, research ASL, and meticulously decode the flag from visual cues. It was a perfect example of how Misc challenges can test your ability to learn and adapt to completely unexpected formats.

### My Contribution & Key Skills

I contributed primarily to the Pwn, Reverse Engineering, and Misc categories.

-   **Pwn & Reverse Engineering:** My work here involved the core fundamentals of binary analysis. I used **Ghidra** to decompile and analyze C-based executables, identify memory corruption vulnerabilities or logical flaws, and then script exploits to gain control or extract flags.
-   **Misc:** Beyond the ASL challenge, I also tackled a geolocation problem, applying my OSINT skills to pinpoint a specific location from limited information. This category was a fantastic test of lateral thinking.

### Key Takeaways

-   **Solidifying Core Skills:** The pwn and rev challenges were excellent practice for reinforcing my binary analysis workflow under competitive pressure.
-   **Thinking Outside the Box:** The ASL challenge was a powerful lesson in how the best solution sometimes comes from the most unexpected fields of knowledge.
-   **Performing at Scale:** Achieving a high rank in a CTF with 1000 teams is a great validation of our team's skill level and ability to perform in a large, competitive field.
