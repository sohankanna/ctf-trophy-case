### Personal Reflection

The HTB Binary Badlands University CTF was a fantastic and challenging event. As a team, we performed well, placing in the top 25% of all participating university teams. This competition was a significant learning experience for me, especially in the categories that were heavily featured.

It was my first deep dive into complex reverse engineering and forensics challenges under time pressure, and it pushed me to learn and apply new techniques rapidly.

### What I Learned & Key Takeaways

This event was instrumental in building my hands-on skills in several key areas:

-   **Reverse Engineering:** I gained significant practical experience using **Ghidra** to decompile and analyze binaries. I learned to navigate complex code, identify key functions, and understand program logic to find vulnerabilities or hidden flags. This was where I spent most of my time and learned the most.

-   **Programming & Scripting:** Many challenges required scripting to solve efficiently. I heavily utilized **Python** for automating tasks, interacting with remote services, and crafting solutions for pwn and crypto challenges.

-   **Forensics:** The event featured some excellent forensics challenges. I got valuable hands-on practice analyzing packet captures (`.pcap` files) with **Wireshark**, filtering through network traffic to reconstruct files and conversations to uncover the flag.
