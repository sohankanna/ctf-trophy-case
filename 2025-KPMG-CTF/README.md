### Personal Reflection

The KPMG Cyber CTF was a distinct and valuable experience. Unlike typical student competitions, this was a professional event designed to identify talent, with top performers being considered for career opportunities. The challenges were geared towards real-world scenarios, and the entire event was run through a custom, immersive command-line interface, which was a fantastic touch.

### Highlight: Modern Security Challenges in the Cloud

The absolute highlight for me was tackling the **Cloud Exploitation** challenges. As shown in the category breakdown, these made up 25% of the event, and I successfully solved both.

This involved navigating simulated cloud environments, identifying common misconfigurations, and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive information. It was a practical and engaging way to apply modern security skills, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of thinking like an attacker in a cloud-native setting.

### What I Learned & Key Takeaways

This CTF was an excellent measure of a well-rounded skill set, and I demonstrated proficiency across multiple domains.

-   **Cloud Security:** Confirmed my practical skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure.
-   **Cryptography:** Solved 2 crypto challenges, showcasing a strong understanding of cryptographic principles and weaknesses.
-   **Broad Versatility:** Successfully solved challenges across **Web, Mobile, Scripting, and Misc** categories, proving my ability to adapt to different types of problems.
-   **Professional Problem-Solving:** The lack of a public leaderboard shifted the focus from speed to methodology. The goal was to demonstrate a thoughtful and effective approach to security problems, which is exactly what's required in a professional role.
