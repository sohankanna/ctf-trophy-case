### Personal Reflection

I am incredibly proud of my team's performance at the BSides Bangalore CTF, where we secured a top 5 finish in a highly competitive environment. **The achievement was made even more rewarding as our placement earned us free tickets to attend the official BSides conference**, allowing us to connect with industry professionals and learn from the talks and workshops. It was a fantastic recognition of our team's hard work and skill.

### My Contribution & Key Skills

As shown in the point breakdown, I contributed **1,500 points** to our team's total, specializing in the more technical, low-level categories.

-   **My Role:** I was the primary driver for our team in **Binary Exploitation (725 pts)** and **Forensics (375 pts)**. I also provided key solves in **Reverse Engineering (200 pts)** and **Reconnaissance (200 pts)**.
-   **Technical Approach:** My main focus was tackling the binary challenges. My workflow involved using **Ghidra** to decompile and meticulously analyze the executables. By unraveling the code's logic and identifying vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or format string bugs, I was able to devise and script exploits to capture the flags. This hands-on experience under pressure was invaluable.

### Key Takeaways

-   **Specialization Pays Off:** This CTF confirmed my passion and aptitude for binary analysis and exploitation. Being able to specialize and provide deep expertise in a critical area was essential to our team's success.
-   **High-Stakes Problem Solving:** BSides events attract serious talent. Successfully debugging exploits and analyzing complex files in a timed, competitive setting was a major confidence booster.
-   **Bridging Competition and Community:** **Winning conference tickets was a powerful reminder of how CTF competitions are an integral part of the larger cybersecurity community, providing pathways to professional networking and learning.**
