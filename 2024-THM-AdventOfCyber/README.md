### Personal Reflection

The Advent of Cyber is a fantastic annual event, and I was committed to completing every challenge to broaden my cybersecurity knowledge. Over 24 days, the event covered an impressive range of topics, spanning both defensive (Blue Team) and offensive (Red Team) security domains. It was a great way to stay sharp and learn something new every single day of the month.

### Highlight: Bridging the Digital and Physical Worlds

The most fascinating takeaway for me was the day focused on Operational Technology (OT) security. The challenge involved exploiting a system that managed a building's environmental controls (like heating and cooling).

Successfully hijacking this system was a powerful demonstration of how cyberattacks can have tangible, real-world consequences. It drove home the critical importance of securing Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and was a memorable lesson in the expanding scope of cybersecurity beyond just data and networks.

### What I Learned & Key Takeaways

This event provided hands-on experience across a wide spectrum of security tools and concepts:

-   **Defensive Security (Blue Team):** Gained practical experience with SIEM tools, specifically using **Elastic SIEM** to ingest logs, hunt for threats, and identify malicious activity within a network.
-   **Offensive Security (Red Team):** Practiced ethical hacking techniques against various targets, including exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications and other systems.
-   **OT/ICS Security:** Explored the unique security challenges of remote control systems and learned the fundamentals of how they can be targeted and compromised.
-   **Overall Versatility:** The daily format forced me to quickly switch contexts between different security domains, reinforcing a versatile and adaptive problem-solving mindset.
